My name is Souradeep Sil. I am currently on a mission to learn more about tech, free open source softwares, writing code and learn some UX/UI skills. 

I am a budding content writer and have ghostwritten a few articles before and will link them [here](https://souradeepsil.github.io/content/). See if they are up to your standards and whether the style is right up your alley. Like what you see? Consider hiring me for gigs! Did I mention that I'm good at UX/UI design too?

You'd not want to dismiss my photography skills. While it's not extraordinary, it's nothing to scoff at either. Take a [look](https://www.instagram.com/sour_artistry/) if you want and decide for yourself. You can find them here.

Now to tell you about my academic interests. In short, I'm an ardent fan of everything computer and biology related. Right now my goal is learning computational biology and bioinformatics to contribute to the medical fraternity for a better and safer tomorrow for all of us. I'm interested in omics technology, machine learning, molecular docking, and pharmacology.

- I'm a great cook
- I shoot good pictures
- I'm great at planning stuff ahead of time

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so just wait for me to make up a believeable story that'll touch your heart. Thanks for sticking with me.
