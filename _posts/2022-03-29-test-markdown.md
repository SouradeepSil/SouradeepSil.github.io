Having a garage door that works properly and without issue is one of the smaller, less noticed pleasures in life. But keeping it that way is an exercise unto itself. Nobody wants to get caught off-guard by a faulty garage door just when they’re about to get into their car for work. A faulty or unserviced garage door can be a hazard not only to you but also to your family. Fortunately, such mishaps can be avoided through proper and timely garage door service.

##Do garage doors need maintenance?
Both residential and commercial garage doors need proper and timely maintenance. The majority of individuals only service their garage doors when something breaks. Unfortunately, this is more expensive in the long term and can result in catastrophic injuries or pose a hazard to you and your family.

Even though garage doors are basic machinery, they are subject to wear and tear like any mechanical device. As a result, it’s vital to keep your garage door in good working order by doing routine maintenance on it on a regular basis.

Many warranties and conditional agreements are dependent on the consistent and timely maintenance of your garage doors. To save yourself the trouble, it is advised that you avail professional residential and commercial garage door service.

Professional servicing also lengthens the longevity of the garage door through proactive and preventative care. This saves you a lot of money by not having to perform repairs on individual parts that may break down over time or replacing the entire garage door itself long before its expected lifespan.

##7 signs that your garage door is faulty
Luckily, it’s not hard to diagnose a faulty garage door. The following are some common symptoms that signal a problem with your garage door that requires at the very least a repair (and possibly a complete replacement) of the garage door assembly:

-The door doesn’t open or close or opens or closes only halfway.
-Staggered or jittery operation of the door shutter.
-Unusually noisy during operation.
-The door continues to remain inoperable in spite of a working motor
-Can be operated manually but not through the remote.
-Visible damage on any part of the garage door assembly.
-You need excessive force to manually operate the garage door.

##Should you try to service a garage door by yourself?
Unless you know what you’re doing, have past experience, or are qualified to conduct these repairs yourself, it is not recommended that you try to service your garage door yourself. It is recommended that you hire a professional technician to fix your garage door. A garage door has a lot of moving parts that all function together in intricate ways. It’s also easy to void the manufacturer’s warranty if you attempt to service it yourself.

##What to check for when you get your garage door serviced?
Consider the following factors when getting your garage door repaired:

###Rollers and hinges
Rollers and hinges should always be in perfect condition. Since these parts are prone to splitting and cracking, they should be checked and repaired regularly to ensure they are in proper working order.

###Tracks
When you want to open or close the garage door, the garage door tracks secure the door rollers and allow them to glide from the garage floor to the garage ceiling. Make sure they are clear of any unwanted material like leaves and dust. Wipe it down with soapy water if necessary.

###Door balance
If your garage door is partly open and you notice it moving up and down, it is a clear sign the torsion needs to be adjusted. Old springs tend to break when they are worn out or in the winter during cold temperatures. A professional repair technician should be able to balance your doors and replace any worn-out springs easily.

###Sensor
The garage door sensor is a piece of safety equipment that helps avoid accidents. This part of the garage door detects whether there is someone or something underneath it before closing to prevent the door from falling on them. On both sides of the garage door, these sensors are located near the floor. If you stand in front of the sensors and perform a simple test, you’ll be able to tell whether they’re working or not.

###Lubrication
Do you hear an unusual squeaking sound when you open or close your garage door? This means your garage door needs to be lubricated. All metallic moving parts must be lubricated with a non-greasy, non-silicone-based garage door lubricant.

Remember to open up the motor and lubricate all of the nylon parts with grease – especially the drive gear. Paying special attention to hinges, rollers, and springs is essential, especially during winter as these objects require more lubrication during cold months.

###Bottom seal and weather sealing
Depending on the condition of the bottom seal and weather sealing , it might need to be replaced. The garage door should not have gaps that allow air and light to enter. If you notice any of these problems, it might mean the bottom seal is experiencing wear from normal use, shrinkage from moisture, or both.

##How often should you service your garage door?
There are a plethora of factors that play a key role in the degradation and aging of a garage door, and most of them boil down to its timely upkeep and how often you use your garage door. The frequency of service depends upon the materials, quality, and other factors tied to the frequency of use.

As a general guideline, service your garage door at least every three thousand cycles. Obviously, this will take various amounts of time for different individuals. The completion of three thousand cycles may take anywhere from a few months to a few years based on how frequently you use your garage doors.

For people with moderate garage door use, it’s advised to go for an annual maintenance routine. If you’re someone who uses their garage doors a lot, then you should service the doors at least twice a year. You will also need to pay attention to how frequently your location’s weather changes and make adjustments to your maintenance schedule accordingly.

Specific components, such as springs and gears, are more susceptible to breakage during cold weather. Therefore, service should be performed in the fall season, when you need to prepare for harsh cold temperatures and the snowy winter, and also during early spring, when the moisture levels and the temperature begin to change.

##Conclusion
As a rule of thumb, it’s recommended that you get at least one annual service performed on the garage door by a qualified technician if you use the garage door regularly. If your usage is more than usual, then semi-annual or quarterly servicing is recommended. Don’t forget to conduct diagnostic checks in order to ascertain the condition of your garage door. A well-maintained garage door will be one less headache that you don’t have to worry about.
